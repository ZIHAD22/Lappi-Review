        "description" : "I was a bit skeptical switching from PC to Mac after all of these years but I couldn't be happier. This MacBook Air is so sleek and smooth. Though getting used to a new OS may take a little time, it was well worth spending a little extra money to get such a solid computer. For others who may be a little frustrated with the change from PC to Mac, take the time to go through Mac tutorials. It's well worth the change and I would do it all over again. I always considered Macbook's to be over priced but having used one now, I can say you are getting what your paying for, trust me. It's amazing how this laptop never freezes up like my PC's kept doing on me. Love this MacBook Air!",
